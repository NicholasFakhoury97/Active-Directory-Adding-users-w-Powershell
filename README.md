# Active-Directory-Adding-users-w-Powershell
In this lab, we will set up a basic Windows networking environment with Active Directory, DHCP, and routing. Weâ€™ll use Oracle VirtualBox to create virtual machines (VMs) for the domain controller and client machines. The goal is to simulate an enterprise network environment.

### Task 2: Firewall Rule Policy Configuration
1. Create an Organizational Unit (OU) in Active Directory.
2. Move the client object to the new OU.
3. Create and configure a Group Policy Object (GPO) to block RDP.
4. Link the GPO to the OU.

### Task 3: Rule Verification
1. Update Group Policy on the client.
2. Verify the new firewall rule on the client.
3. Test and verify RDP connectivity.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure you have administrative permissions on all machines.
- Document any issues encountered during the lab.
