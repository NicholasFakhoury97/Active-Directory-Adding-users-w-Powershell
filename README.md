# Active-Directory-Adding-users-w-Powershell
In this lab, we will set up a basic Windows networking environment with Active Directory, DHCP, and routing. Weâ€™ll use Oracle VirtualBox to create virtual machines (VMs) for the domain controller and client machines. The goal is to simulate an enterprise network environment.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Windows Command Line</b>
- <b>Powershell</b>
- <b>Active Directory Domain Service</b>


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Virtualbox 7.0</b>
- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b>
- <b>Windows Server 2022</b>

<h2>Lab Setup Summary </h2>

**Environments Used:**
- **VirtualBox 7.0:** Used to create and run virtual machines (VMs) for the domain controller (DC) and client.
- **Windows 10 Pro:** Installed on the client VM to connect to the domain.
- **Windows Server 2022:** Installed on the Domain Controller (DC) VM to manage the network, Active Directory, and DHCP.


   <h2>VM Setup and Configuration </h2>
   - **Create Domain Controller (DC) VM:**
   
     - In **VirtualBox**, create a new VM and install **Windows Server 2022**.
 
     - Set up two network adapters:
       - **Adapter 1:** NAT (external internet connection)
       - **Adapter 2:** Internal (private network connection)
     - After installing the server, set **static IP** for the internal network adapter (`172.16.0.1`), and configure the external adapter to auto-configure via the router.

   <h2>Install and Configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) </h2>
  
   - From the **Server Manager**, install the **Active Directory Domain Services** role.
     
   - After installation, promote the server to a **Domain Controller** by setting up a new domain (e.g., **mydomainlab.com**).
     
   - Configure DNS and set up the **Domain Controller Options** with a password for the Directory Services.

   <h2>Create Domain, Organizational Units, and Users </h2>
   - Once the Domain Controller is set up, use **Active Directory Users and Computers** to:
     - Create a new **Organizational Unit (OU)**, e.g., **_ADMINS**.
     - Add a new user, **Jon Doe**, and assign them to the **Domain Admins** group.
     
   - This user will have administrative privileges, and you can log into the domain with their credentials.

   <h2>Network Configuration - Routing and DHCP Setup </h2>
   - **Enable Routing & NAT:**
     - In the **Server Manager**, install the **Routing and Remote Access** role to allow **Network Address Translation (NAT)**, enabling internet access for the internal network.
     - Configure the domain controller as the **public interface** for the routing and complete the setup.
 
   - **Set up DHCP:**
     - Install the **DHCP Server** role through the **Server Manager** and configure a **DHCP scope** to assign IP addresses (e.g., from `172.16.0.100` to `172.16.0.200`).
     - Set the **DC Server** as the **default gateway** for clients and authorize the DHCP server.

   <h2>Create Users Using PowerShell </h2>
   - Use **PowerShell scripts** to automate the creation of 1,000 domain users. By setting the **execution policy** to **Unrestricted**, the script can be executed to add multiple users efficiently.

   <h2>Client Setup </h2>
   - **Install Windows 10 Client:**
     - Create a **Windows 10** client VM in **VirtualBox**, configure the internal network adapter to connect to the domain.
     - Install Windows 10 and, once set up, join it to the **mydomainlab.com** domain using the **Domain Admins** account credentials.
   
   <h2>Verification and Testing </h2>
   - **Test Network Connectivity:**
     - From the Windows 10 client, ping external websites to confirm internet connectivity via the **Domain Controller**.
   
   - **Remote Desktop Setup:**
     - Enable **Remote Desktop (RDP)** access on the Windows client and configure the **Windows Firewall** rules to allow RDP traffic.
     - Verify that the **RDP** connection works between the client and the domain controller.
